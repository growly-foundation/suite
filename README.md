  - Aggregate data from Sonic ecosystem, including yield opportunities, LST APYs, recommended Dapp, MySonic points
- AI Agent to recommend user to take action on Sonic (rebalance or hold (yield)) to maximize the yield and point farming

## Local Development

### üê≥ Publish Docker images

The two `agent` and `server` will be bundled as docker image and push to registry (currently using DigitalOcean platform)

Please see more details on `apps/server/Dockerfile` and `apps/agent/Dockerfile`

Make sure you installed and setup `doctl` ([docs](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/how-to/install/)) on your local machine.

1. Build server: `make build-server`
2. Publish server: `make push-server`

(apply the same for agent by replacing `server` to `agent` in make commands)
